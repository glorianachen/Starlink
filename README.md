# Starlink project

React.js-based Trajectory Visualization of SpaceX Starlink Satellites 
Here is the demo of this project:https://www.loom.com/share/92cf5c9837cc47ea9e5ab57151010d50

## Description

•	Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using React.js and D3 to track all real-time satellites by geo-location

•	Implemented selectors based on altitude, location and duration for refined search of satellites 

•	Designed the animation of selected satellite paths on a world map, which utilized D3 for user-friendliness



## Project Highlights
Firstly you set the parameters of the satellites:

 Then the list shows all satellites. You can chooose some of them and type the duration time.

 Then the satellites tracking will show up in the world map. It is really fun!
